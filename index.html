          A daring rescue mission was undertaken by local firefighters in Hull
          yesterday evening after a cat became stranded in a tree on Elmwood
          Road. The feline, a grey and white tom cat, had apparently climbed up
          the tree in the early hours of the morning, much to the dismay of its
          owners. Witnesses reported that the cat had been terrorizing the
          neighbourhood for weeks, knocking over trash cans and scratching
          garden furniture. Despite this, a group of well-meaning residents
          called for the cat's rescue, citing concerns for the animal's safety.
          <br /><br />
          However, not everyone in the neighbourhood was pleased with the
          outcome of the rescue mission. Several neighbours, who wished to
          remain anonymous, revealed that they had actually placed the cat in
          the tree as a means of ridding themselves of the pest. "We were so fed
          up with the cat's antics that we thought it was the best solution,"
          said one neighbour. "But now, it seems like everyone is celebrating
          the cat's rescue, without considering the fact that we were just
          trying to do what was best for our community." The cat has since been
          returned to its relieved owners, but the controversy surrounding its
          rescue has left many in the neighbourhood scratching their heads.
